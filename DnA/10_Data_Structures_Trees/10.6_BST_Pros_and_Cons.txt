BST: Binary Search Tree

Pros:				
	- Better than O(n) assuming that they're balanced
	- Ordered
	- Flexible Size: b/c we can place the node anywhere in memory

Cons:
	- No O(1) operations
	- Compared to an  array, a lookup would be a lot faster
	- Insert and Delete will be a lot faster
	- Compared to Hash Table, 
		- BST has sorted data
		- structure of parent/child relationship
	- Remember they're not the fastest for all operations.
