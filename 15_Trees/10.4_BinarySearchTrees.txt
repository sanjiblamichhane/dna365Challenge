This is the most common Data Structure.

What is a BST?
	- they are good at searching
	- great for comparing things.
	
	Why is it better than Hash table?
		- because it has relationships
		- parent/child relationship
		- BST preserve these relationships

		Rules:
			- all child node on the right should be greater than the one on the left.
			- a node can only have upto two children
			- advatage: searching and lookup is very easy. 

			Example:
					         101
					       /     \
					      33      105
					     /  \     /   \
					   9    37   104  144
			lookup() - O(log N)
			insert() - O(log N)
			delete() - O(log N)
